          Welcome to My Veggie Spot, Ottawa's cozy little eatery for some really great plant-based meals!<br><br>
          We believe vegetarian eating should be exciting, fulfilling, and bursting with flavors. Our menu is inspired by international cuisines and prepared fresh every day with local and seasonal ingredients. Whether you are an old-school vegetarian, an adventurous gourmand, or just craving a healthy yet filling meal, we sure can satisfy your cravings.<br><br>
          Beyond just being a restaurant, we at My Veggie Spot like to think of it as a community space where dirty fingers, grubby elbows and good vibes are meshes. So, lay back, soak up the ambience, and revel in meals that are gentle to the environment and made with love.<br><br>
          Visit us for an unforgettable veggie experience, one bite at a time.
